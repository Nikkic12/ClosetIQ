**Node.js must be installed on system as a prerequisite**

To install dependencies for and run frontend:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

To install dependencies for and run backend:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev [or] node server.js
```

You must run <code>npm install</code> after cloning the repo to get the <code>node_modules/</code> dependencies directory in both <code>client/</code> and <code>server/</code> in order for frontend and backend to run properly.
